# Stroop Effect

Explore Stroop effect with a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition.

I performed dependent t-test on the dataset to compare the means of two related groups to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between these means.
The groups are related because both participants are present in the two groups. This is a one-tail test. Moreover, due to the small sample size (n<25) t- test is more suitable.
<p>
My null hypothesis: The conditions does not affect how the participants recognize the color of the words.  
Alternative hypothesis: It takes longer for participants to recognize color in noncongruent conditions than for congruent.  
Hypothesis in mathematical terms:  
<ul>
<li>H0=X_bar1 = X_bar2</li>
<li>Ha= X_bar1>X_bar2</li>
</ul>
</p>

I decided to test the data at 0.95 confidence level and the critical statistics value is 1.7138. The t statistics is -8.02070694411. Also we test the p value at alpha=0.05, and p-value we calculated is at 4.10300058571e-08. We reject null hypothesis and come to the conclusion that participants take longer to recognize color in noncongruent conditions. 

The results match up with my expections.
